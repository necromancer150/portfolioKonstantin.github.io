Two years ago i had a work experience during year 9 and I went to my orthodontest. I had a lot of fun during these two weeks. A more recent event was MUN 'Model United Nations'. In this event each person got a country they had to represent and then debate on a given topic
										and try to debate in the view of their country. During this conference I was the delagate of Ukraine debating on <strong>Safeguarding peacekeepers in armed conflicts</strong>, where the resolution of my group has succeeded. This year at my school we will host a shorter conference where a good friend of mine a myself will be chairs in the commitee of <strong>Regulating drone warfare 'DISEC'</strong>
